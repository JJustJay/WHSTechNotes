A game that I have played before is Elden Ring.  What makes the game enjoyable is how action-packed the game is and how the visuals are like.  It uses realistic visuals to make you feel immersed inside of the game.  The combat system makes it feel real as if you are actually fighting the mobs yourself.  The character design also uses realistic visuals to make it look appealing, which the character creator allowing you to create any type of character you want.

For You: Maybe have instructions on the white board for more people to see, so people can have a better understanding. For Me: I did not need to go along with the instructions so I did not have any problems.

It is important to follow instructions when trying to code because if you do not follow the rules, you could mess up.  By following instructions, you are able to know what to do and not make mistakes.  However, by not following the instructions, you may make a mistake that could ruin your entire code, and you may only realize it once you finish with the code and run it.  Following the instructions as given is like building with legos.  UWhen you follow the instructions, there is no way you mess up, but if you don't follow the instructions, you may mess up.  Overall, it is important to follow the instructions when trying to code in order to not mess up the code.

A daily activity that uses computer science is gaming.  Online games require computer science to run.  This means that coding is an essenstial to electronic games, showing that playing games rely on computer science.  If computer science was gone, there would be less electronic games.

A job that I would want to have using computer sience is Video Game Developer.  People with the job create games that people would enjoy.  The skills requiured to have the job is to have experience in coding, creating ideas for concepts with game designing, and overall having a great imagination.  Education rarely matters as anyone could start, most preferably would be after highschool.  Experience required should be self explanatory: having the ability to code and create games.  Career development is that people can check your resume of the games that you have made which may or may not have succeeded.   This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science because by having the ability to code and create games, I can pursue this career to make a solid amount of money and having experience later in life.

Coding can help improve problem solving skills by learning how to think more about a topic to create more well thought ideas.  When coding, you use what you know in order to create something new, entirely made from code.  Understanding code can help in industries unrelated to technology by allowing ideas to fluorish in more off-topic conversations.  Coding enhances creativity by pushing the limits of what can be created by the human mind.  Coding helps with collaboration because in coding, you are using languages that can also be read by other people, allowing for more developed ideas across the coding genre.

AI can improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation by making it more easier and more reliable.  By improving healthcare innovation, it can make more precise tasks that normal humans cannot do, like putting a robotic pill into a infected body to kill cancer.  It can be used in education to make learning more simpler and more undestandable with easy to understand summaries of topics that may be hard to understand normally.  AI can also improve transporation for a more faster travel.  Sooner or later, these new innovations will change the world entirely for a much more improved lifestyle.

On the other hand, AI can be dangerous as they can be used for harm, they could not be as reliable as we think, and that they can be more sensitive to danger.  AI machines could potentially break out, doing things that it isn't supposed to be doing.  AI machines can also be less reliable and productive in certain situations as they can be damaged.  AI machines can also be sensitive to danger as people could hack these machines in order to use them in harmful ways.  Overall, there are many good and bad ways AI can be implemented in industries for the greater good if used correctly.

During election days, there can be many positive and concerns about using technology during the election process.  One positive aspect that can effect elections is social media.  Socia media can be used to spread information about those being elected, allowing easy influence across the country in a quick period.  One concern about using technology for elections is by using AI.  With the creation of AI, spreading misinformation has been getting more easier day by day.  One example of this is the use of deepfakes.  By using deepfakes to create a fake persona of someone being elected, the influence of people over voting can be manipulated in a bad way.

It is important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing content online because personal information is very important to you.  If that information was leaked online, people can use it without your consent, which can lead to very bad things.  To ensure the protection of personal information being sent online, people can make sure what they do does not lead to information being leaked, so being smart with what you do can help.  I have not sent anything personal online so I cannot relate, but if I did I would just figure out how to get it removed.  You can balance being open and collaborate with others while protecting your personal information by not talking about it at all.

A current event that interests me is school.  I know that if I make it through school with flying colors, I can succeed in life, which makes me so interested in all of the things I do at school.  I use problem solving in almost all of my classes, the technology via chromebook to do work, and analyzing questions to figure out the best answer.  To know that I can possibly get a scholarship, get into a college of my liking, to get a good paying job and to live my life to the fullest, excites me a lot.

The advancements of computer science play a role in my event by pushing the human limits of technology in order to teach us better.  I try my absolute best to use all the tools I am given to try and excel in my classes.  I go through my school life knowing that everything could change for the better.  With this in mind, technologies will help me alot, and I am grateful.
