A game that I have played before is Elden Ring.  What makes the game enjoyable is how action-packed the game is and how the visuals are like.  It uses realistic visuals to make you feel immersed inside of the game.  The combat system makes it feel real as if you are actually fighting the mobs yourself.  The character design also uses realistic visuals to make it look appealing, which the character creator allowing you to create any type of character you want.

It is important to follow instructions when trying to code because if you do not follow the rules, you could mess up.  By following instructions, you are able to know what to do and not make mistakes.  However, by not following the instructions, you may make a mistake that could ruin your entire code, and you may only realize it once you finish with the code and run it.  Following the instructions as given is like building with legos.  UWhen you follow the instructions, there is no way you mess up, but if you don't follow the instructions, you may mess up.  Overall, it is important to follow the instructions when trying to code in order to not mess up the code.

A job that I would want to have using computer sience is Video Game Developer.  People with the job create games that people would enjoy.  The skills requiured to have the job is to have experience in coding, creating ideas for concepts with game designing, and overall having a great imagination.  Education rarely matters as anyone could start, most preferably would be after highschool.  Experience required should be self explanatory: having the ability to code and create games.  Career development is that people can check your resume of the games that you have made which may or may not have succeeded.   This job aligns with my interests and goals in computer science because by having the ability to code and create games, I can pursue this career to make a solid amount of money and having experience later in life.

Coding can help improve problem solving skills by learning how to think more about a topic to create more well thought ideas.  When coding, you use what you know in order to create something new, entirely made from code.  Understanding code can help in industries unrelated to technology by allowing ideas to fluorish in more off-topic conversations.  Coding enhances creativity by pushing the limits of what can be created by the human mind.  Coding helps with collaboration because in coding, you are using languages that can also be read by other people, allowing for more developed ideas across the coding genre.

AI can improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation by making it more easier and more reliable.  By improving healthcare innovation, it can make more precise tasks that normal humans cannot do, like putting a robotic pill into a infected body to kill cancer.  It can be used in education to make learning more simpler and more undestandable with easy to understand summaries of topics that may be hard to understand normally.  AI can also improve transporation for a more faster travel.  Sooner or later, these new innovations will change the world entirely for a much more improved lifestyle.

On the other hand, AI can be dangerous as they can be used for harm, they could not be as reliable as we think, and that they can be more sensitive to danger.  AI machines could potentially break out, doing things that it isn't supposed to be doing.  AI machines can also be less reliable and productive in certain situations as they can be damaged.  AI machines can also be sensitive to danger as people could hack these machines in order to use them in harmful ways.  Overall, there are many good and bad ways AI can be implemented in industries for the greater good if used correctly.

During election days, there can be many positive and concerns about using technology during the election process.  One positive aspect that can effect elections is social media.  Socia media can be used to spread information about those being elected, allowing easy influence across the country in a quick period.  One concern about using technology for elections is by using AI.  With the creation of AI, spreading misinformation has been getting more easier day by day.  One example of this is the use of deepfakes.  By using deepfakes to create a fake persona of someone being elected, the influence of people over voting can be manipulated in a bad way.

It is important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing content online because personal information is very important to you.  If that information was leaked online, people can use it without your consent, which can lead to very bad things.  To ensure the protection of personal information being sent online, people can make sure what they do does not lead to information being leaked, so being smart with what you do can help.  I have not sent anything personal online so I cannot relate, but if I did I would just figure out how to get it removed.  You can balance being open and collaborate with others while protecting your personal information by not talking about it at all.

A current event that interests me is school.  I know that if I make it through school with flying colors, I can succeed in life, which makes me so interested in all of the things I do at school.  I use problem solving in almost all of my classes, the technology via chromebook to do work, and analyzing questions to figure out the best answer.  To know that I can possibly get a scholarship, get into a college of my liking, to get a good paying job and to live my life to the fullest, excites me a lot.

The advancements of computer science play a role in my event by pushing the human limits of technology in order to teach us better.  I try my absolute best to use all the tools I am given to try and excel in my classes.  I go through my school life knowing that everything could change for the better.  With this in mind, technologies will help me alot, and I am grateful.

Technology has advanced in many ways.  It changed the way we do agriculture by making it more easy,  with the use of tractors and other farm vehicles.  We produce better produce from breeding, mastering the art of agriculture.  We distribute produce easily in stores.  During the holiday seasons, food is changed to be more respective of the holiday.  Stores would sell more holiday-themed foods to attract more costumers.  On the downside, technology can make mistakes.  Foods tend to be brought back to a company due to a disease that may be running around.  Overall, food can be good for everyone to consume as long as it is gathered safely

From what I have researched, quantum computing allow people to solve problems faster and better than normal computers.  These computers incorporate quantum physics in order to solve problems.  This excites me excited because we can finally solve most of the unanswered mathmatical questions and other questions alike that have not been solved in a long time.  This type of technology can be useful in my current field of interest, general engineering, by allowing me to percieve ideas more easily.  The only recommendation towards the advancement of this technology is if it can be released to the people, only because I want a gaming computer that can run games even more smoothly.

To me, the term "brain rot" is the types of media which you cannot escape, rotting your brain with pointless nonsense.  if anything, the type of media that I have been seeing lately this year has definitely had a negative impact on my mental health as I have been losing motivation on things that I would consider as part of my lifestyle, like small hobbies such as working out and drawing.  The new brain-rot terms connect with technology by the way we speak with other people online.  As hard as it is to get away from brain-rot,  it is possible to get away from this by using phones less frequently and do more cool in life.

What I enjoyed about last semester, which also includes joining the class at the beginning of the school year, was the upgraded versions of the computers from the last time I was here during my sophomore year.  With these new and improved computers, we are able to do many more things than just "coding", allowing us to use better applications which we could not have used on the old computers.  In this semester, I plan on finishing up my unity missions in order to pass the unity test and get my certification.

 With the effect of relying on AI intelligence,  it shifts the tech industry towards using these AI skills over traditional tech roles.  My thoughts on the shift is that theres a good side and bad side about it.  The good thing is that production could increase alongside with efficiency, but the downside is that there can be errors in the coding, which can result in malfunctioning.  In my opinion, AI tools will limit opportunities for workers.  Since there would be more use of AI in industries, that would lower the amount of jobs for workers.  In a rapidly changing job market like this, I don't really know what I would do since I have not experienced something like this in my life yet.

# January 22, 2025
I think the way users would be impacted by technology companies that have been interfered by the government is that users would be given extra defense to what they have online.  This is because the government just wants to make sure that an application created by a different country is safe to use for its country's people, and they wouldn't want their people to use an app that has risks.  In my opinion, tech companies like Tiktok could address security concerns while still being able to operate globally by being more open with what type of security they have.

If I was a developer at Tiktok working on new privacy features, I would implement better security to prove that my appplication cannot be hacked and information wouldn't get stolen that easily.  What I can learn from the Tiktok ban situation and apply to my own game designing projects is that just like the risk of hacking, I would try and prevent the risks of bugs and glitches that may occur in the process of creatimg my project.  This is to ensure that my game can run smoothly for everyone that is playing it.

Integrating technology into avation can increase safety by allowing for less collisions and more precise routing when flying.  Less collisions and precise routing can result in less people dying due to aviation problems every year.  One problem that may have happened that resulted in the collision on January 29th could have been from software errors or bugs in the console.  In order to prevent future situations like this, there should be better technology integrated in aviation that can prevent any similar situations like this one.  

In general, changing the regulations and technology of Air Traffic Control Systems can also help with increasing aviation safety.  During the collision last week, it was shown that both of the paths of the plane and helicoppter had intersected each other.  There should be regulations that should be changed that prevents helicopters from flying near landing areas of airplanes.  There should also be regulations that add limits to where certain aircraft (that are not related to an airport) should not be able to go near any public airports.  There should also be more technology that can show the locations of nearby aircraft, not just only planes. Lastly, I think that there should be private spots for army-related aircraft to do training.  This is how I believe technology should be used in increasing the safety of aviation in our present world.

Technology can be used to help educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth language by seeing the patterns of how youth language is being spread, for instance, slang.  Educators can analyze slamg through technology, seeing how much of an influence this change has on how kids talk.  Using this method, educators could teach kids better ways to communicate with one another, not just in school but also online.  With this in mind, integrating slang translation tools into ou technological society can benefit us by allowing for a more easy way to understand conversations of people in different generations.  Because of the way kids speak nowawdays, it tends to be hard for adults to understand what they are trying to say, showing how integrating slang translation could potentially benefit our society.

In my personal opinion, I believe that schools or youth organizations should definitely teach kids the appropriate slang to improve communication.  When I was a little kid, I didn't learn any slang words until the stat of 5th grade but now kids are learning these types of slang in earlier grades, even in kindergarten!  With this in mind, this would create a confusion between kids and adults becaus as time passes... slang changes... so teaching kids the appropiate use of slang can help their communication skills improve so that they could talk just a little bit better.

During the spring break, I actually started relearning how to code in python.  I thought about the idea because of how empty and lazy I would be whenvever I have no school.  During these days off, I would do absolutely nothing besides helping my family, playing with my little brothers and being on my phone 24/7.  I thought to myself that I should do better, so I decided to relearn how to code in python so that I can pass time and not be on my phone, actually learn something useful, and hopefully use my newfound knowledge to get a successful life.  This even correlates with what we have been doing in the entirety of computer science.  I used my previous knowledge from the past classes to grow, and hopefully I will succeed.

In my genuine opinion, I believe that the effect of technology, especially AI, is making March Madness both thrilling and not thrilling.  Technology makes March Madness thrilling because of exactly what you said in our warm up.  The prediction brackets being made makes it so that people can gamble their life savnings away.  The effect of social media also makes it thrilling because more people can see and witness such events such as March Madness, making it more popular.  This also makes more money for companies in general with the amount of people wanting to see the event.

Now in all honesty, there is many more things that technology and AI makes things thrilling for March Madness, but on the downsides, it gives people less excitement.  This is because people try to predict brackets and the true outcome of the tournament.  I would personally be seeing many theories on YouTube regarding matching and predictions and whoever would come out at the end.  Also people tend to like watching without spoilers/disturbances from technology.  This is because people like knowing what they don't know, like who's playing or not... but that might just be me.

# April 7, 2025
Judging from the fact that the school in Austin has increased in academic performace using AI tools,  the way AI tools can help me perform better, especially when STAAR testing is coming up, by teaching me topics that would be relevant to the STAAR subjects.  By using AI, I can practice answering questions generated by these AI tools that may be useful to the topics in STAAR testing so that I can expand my general knowledge and get a better score on the test.  Using AI tools can not only help with STAAR, but with other classes as well.  

As a personal tutor,  AI can help with problems that could be difficult to understand.  For instance, if I have a hard time trying to understand a topic being discussed by my teacher, I can use AI tools that can make the topic more easier to understand.  This makes AI perfect for tutoring and studying topics in order to have more knowledge in class.  By doing all of this, AI could greatly increase performance in class.  This is why AI is great for studying for STAAR and to be a personal tutor.

With the recent ban of phone usage and access to social media during school days towards students in Florida, I believe such a ban would be detrimental to not only students, but schools itself..  This is because many students use their phones throughout the day.  This includes chatting with friends, searching up answers for questions, and also being in contact with family incase of an emergency.  Removing such rights for students can be very harmful because what if something dangerous were to occur near school grounds?  With no way to contact any family members, this can make students vulnerable,  which would anger many parents.

If such phone bans were to occur in my school, I can gurantee that the school would be "cooked".  I say this because some students here get angered whenever they are told to hide their phones and pay attention in class.  I feel like this would lead to many fights occurring between students and teachers,  ruining my schools reputation.  Because of such bans,  this would also limit student learning because many students search up questions for certain assignments that they consider confusing.  This phone ban would definitely decrease student productivity.  This is why I believe phone bans can be detrimental.

Dear Mr. Murphy, 

 This email is dedicated to my appreciation towards you during my time in your English I class.  I am very very proud for having you as my teacher.  This is because of all the fun times I've had in the class with my friend Kelvin.  Not only were the assignments easy to understand, but whenever we required assistance, you always made it simple and easy to understand.  To this day,  I've been missing that class and I feel jealous of the students that are lucky to have you as their English teacher.  If I had a chance to have you as my teacher again, I would undoubtly take that chance.  As I said before, I am very grateful for having you as my English teacher and I hope to see you again every now and then whenever I walk with Kelvin during passing periods or during the morning.

In my opinion, I believe the 100 people will win because they have more stamina and can fight longer than the gorilla.  This is because as strong as a gorilla may be, it can get tired sooner or later.  There are 100 people, so if they can tire the gorilla out, they can win.  This is why I believe 100 people can beat a gorilla.

After viewing examples of the new trend where students destroy chromebooks, I can say without a doubt in my mind that the actions that these students are doing are very unethical.  I believe such actions are unethical because it is just wrong.  Destroying school property is something that you shouldn't be doing in general.  It also badly influences the next generation, making them do things that should not be done.  Misuse of technology can also be dangerous if you do not know what you are messing with.

Whenever these students try to mess with chromebooks for social attention, they are not wary of the dangerous side effects when messing with them.  The chromebook could explode in front of them that could potentially lead to serious injuries.  It is important to use technology safely to prevent such events from happening.  Being safe can also teach others to be safe, making more of a positive influence towards society.  Overall, it is unethical for students to be messing with chromebooks because it is dangerous and it is also a bad influence to society.

The new cell phone law has impacted students in many ways.  My thoughts about this phone ban is that it is actually good for students, specifically those who wish to excel in school.  Say there is a student who wishes to do work with other classmates, however they are on their phone.  Such students now must focus on their work and communiucate with their peers instead of playing games.  In the end, this phone ban definitely has mixed feelings towards students, but in my eyes, it is a good way for students like me to do work instead of being distracted.

A career that I am investing myself into for the future is robotic engineering.  This career values computer science as it involves coding, which is the heart of robotics.  One example of this is that coding is used to manuever a robot, since without coding, robots wouldn't really be able to do anything.  Coding is a core feature in robotic engineering as it is like the fuel necessary for robotics so that robots can be coded to do many tasks as the coder wishes. In summary, computer science is a necessary factor in robotic engineering as it is the foundation of the career, and without it, the career may not be the same.

For the presidential AI challenge, there are many ways that AI can be used to solve real-world problems.  My idea for using AI to solve a real world problem is by using AI to find new scientific equations or scientific discoveries that can help with creating a renewable energy source.  I believe that energy is hard to get with all of this new technology today.  With the use of AI, it can speed up the process with research, leading to more discoveries being found more quickly.  This idea meets challenge requirements because it involves the usage of AI to be used for a real world problem, which is renewable energy sources.  This idea will impact people by allowing more efficient energy being used for many people in the world.  This is my idea for the presidential AI challenge.

In my opinion, I think working in a virtual store for real money is a bad idea for future jobs.  I believe this is a bad idea because there can be many things that could potentially go wrong in a virtual store.  For instance, there can be hackers that could potentially hack the store and ruin everything.  An example of this is on Roblox, since there are many hackers in the platform that tend to make games miserable for its players.  With this reason, this is why I think working in a virtual store for real money is a bad idea.

I believe the phrase has a deeper meaning.  To me, the phrase is a lifestyle.

If I were in charge of my school, I would treat it's AI policy and technology different than the school that I am currently in.  In this school, we are not allowed to play games at all, and we are not allowed to use our phones because of the ban.  In my school, I would limit AI to some extent, such as adding a rule that blocks any sort of AI tool on the chromebooks.  I would allow my students to use chromebooks for school work, however phones would not be an option.  I will follow the law that states that phones are prohibited during school hours, however I would implement a rule where my students are only allowed their phones during lunch because I believe it is unfair for students to be unable to use their phones during lunch.  This is how I would handle technology and AI policies at my school.

For this assignment, I decided to use Canva AI to create a website that makes a logic puzzle in the form of minesweeper.  In total, there are three versions of the site as I had to change some certain aspects in the website because I wanted the site to be clean and more efficient.  In the first version there are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.  In the second version, I formatted the difficulties to fit in the screen of the website because the hard difficulty would go out of the boundaries of the website.  The third and final version of my website allows for a clean minesweeper experience, where you can type your name and get on the leaderboard of each difficulty, where the fastest completion is on the top of the leaderboard.

The skills and habits that I am proud of this year is the constistency and the amount of work I put into things.  From the start of this year up until now, I have been bombarded with so much things . been given assigfnments after assignments, quizzes after quizzes.  Because of this, I have created a habit of doing work consistently, making sure that all my assignments and such are turned in on time.  I've also developed better skills in learning because I can dive deeper into more vast concepts that I could not have done before this year.

One job that requires drones is cropdusting using a drone.  In this job, programmers use code to automate the drone to do cropdusting on a field.  According to what I have researched, a drone operator in the cropdusting field gets anywhere between $81,500 to $129,500.  The requirements to become cropdusting certified for drones, you must have Part 107 license, programming and coding skills, and informed about how to use a drone.  I would gladly do this job in the future because since we live in Texas, there are many farms, so I could capitalize in this job.

Self-driving cars may fail to recognize/correctly respond to a stopped school bus even with its stop sign because it may not be something that the self-driving car is able to detect.  For example, in a train pass on a road, the train is detected as a bunch of semi-trucks stacked together.  With this example, this means that there are some things that the car has not been programmed to do, resulting in these failures.  If I were a programmer in the Waymo team, I would try to create code that can show these stopped school buses.  I could also try changing the self-driving car's recognition skills so that it can detect any sort of object in its surroundings by using color or some sort of energy waves like radiowaves.
